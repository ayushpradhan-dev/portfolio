## Personal Profile  
As a keen student of economics and self-driven learner, I have transitioned into the data science field, building on my undergraduate degree in financial and business economics to expand my analytical toolkit. By combining economic principles with advanced data science and machine learning techniques, I am developing models with predictive capabilities applicable to economic and financial consulting contexts. I am eager to tackle complex financial challenges and contribute meaningfully to data-driven decision-making in organizational contexts.
